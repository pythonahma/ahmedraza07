Q-11.  WAP to show difference between Structure and Union.
Ans:- A structure stores each member in separate memory locations, whereas a union stores all its members in the same memory location.
Structure: in the case of a structure, there is a specific memory location for every input data member. Thus, it can store multiple values of the various members.
Union: In the case of a Union, there is an allocation of only one shared memory for all the input data members. Thus, it stores one value at a time for all of its members.
