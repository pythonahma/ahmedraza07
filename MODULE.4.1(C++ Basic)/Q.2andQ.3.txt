Q-2. What is OOP? List OOP concepts?
Ans:- OOP is an object-oriented programming technique that combines data and instructions for processing that data into an object that can be used within the program. Object-oriented programming provides concepts that help modelling complicated systems of real world into manageable software solutions.
- OOP  is a programming model based on the concept of objects and classes. In this model, programmers define the functions that can be applicable to the data structures and their data type. Object-oriented programming turns data structure into an object, including both data and functions. It encourages the reusing of these objects in the same and other programmes as well.
List OOP concepts:-
     •	Class
     •	Objects
     •	Data Abstraction 
     •	Encapsulation
     •	Inheritance
     •	Polymorphism
     •	Data Binding
     •	Message Passing

Q-3. What is the difference between OOP and POP?
Ans:- OOP stands for Object Oriented Programing.
     •	POP stands for Procedural Oriented Programming.
     •	OOP follows bottom up approach.
     •	POP follows top down approach.
     •	OOP A program is divided to objects and their interactions.
     •	POP A program is divided into functions and they interacts.
     •	OOP is an Inheritance property is used.
     •	POP Inheritance is not allowed.
     •	OOP It uses access specifier.
     •	POP It doesn’t use access specifier.
     •	OOP Encapsulation is used to hide the data.
     •	POP No data hiding present. Data is globally accessible.
     •	OOP ex. C++, Java etc.
     •	POP ex. C, Pascal etc.
