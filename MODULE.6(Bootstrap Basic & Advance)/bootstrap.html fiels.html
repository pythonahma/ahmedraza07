                    <h3>[1]what are the advantages of Bootstrap?</h3>
                    <strong>Answer:</strong>
                    <li>The bootstrap is an Open Source Front-End framework, used for Web Application
                        development, made up of HTML, CSS and Java Scrip, which twitter has developed.
                    </li>
                    <li>This is a
                        free program that anyone can download and use. And you can run it on any platform
                        (Windows, Linux, Mac). Bootstrap gives you the option of using the Grid System which is
                        known as one of the fastest and simplest ways to create a layout that saves you time.</li>
                    <li>Bootstrap is used to make the website responsive, Responsive means that if you open a
                        website in PC, open it in laptop or open in tablet or open in any small mobile, the
                        screen size of bootstrap website will automatically adjusts, and the website content
                        shows well. </li>

                    <li> Easy to prevent repetitions among multiple projects.
                    <li> Responsive design that can be used to adapt screen sizes.
                    <li> choose what shows and what doesn't on any given device.
                    <li> Maintaining consistency among projects when using multiple developer teams.
                    <li> Quick design of prototypes.
                    <li><b>Bootstrap is Easy to Use:</b> Bootstrap is very easy and quite simple to use for
                        designing and development. Being a new framework there is a lot to learn from it. It can be
                        used with CSS, LESS or SaaS etc.</li>
                    <li> <b>Fast and Time-Saving Framework:</b> Bootstrap is an agile framework which is quite
                        faster than other frameworks. It saves time due to its standard ready-made coding blocks,
                        responsiveness, and cross-browser capabilities.</li>
                    <li> <b>Reinforcement of Grids:</b> One more recommendable feature is that bootstrap holds 12
                        column grid styles and supports responsiveness, counterbalance, and embedded elements.</li>
                    <li><b>Bootstrap is totally Customizable:</b> It is developer friendly and can be customized as
                        per the project requirements. Common CSS, utilities, Javascript Components, and components
                        can compose the appearance to create ease for developers.</li>

                    <h3>[2]what is the Bootstrap Container,and how does it work?</h3>
                    <strong>Answer:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <p> Bootstrap, container is used to set the content's margins dealing with the responsive
                            behaviors of your layout. It contains the row elements and the row elements are the
                            container of columns (known as grid system).</p>
                        <p>Containers are the most basic layout element in Bootstrap and are required when using default
                            grid system. Containers are used to contain, pad, and (sometimes) center the content within
                            them. Although containers can be nested, most layouts do not require a nested container.</p>
                        <p><b>Bootstrap comes with three different containers:</b></p>
                        <li>
                            <p>.container, which sets a max-width at each responsive breakpoint</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>.container-fluid, which is width: 100% at all breakpoints</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>.container-{breakpoint}, which is width: 100% until the specified breakpoint</p>
                        </li>
                        <p>&raquo; It requires use with the default grid system.</p>
                        <p>&raquo; To establish width for the layout to give web content.</p>
                        <p>&raquo; To provide responsive fixed behavior of any web project.</p>
                        <p>&raquo; To sets the content margin dealing with the responsive behavior of your layout.</p>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>[3]what are the default Bootstrap text settings?</h3>
                    <strong>Answer:</strong>
                    <p>Bootstrap 4 uses a default font-size of 16px, and its line-height is 1.5. The default font-family
                        is "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif. In addition, all
                    <p> elements have margin-top: 0 and margin-bottom: 1rem (16px by default).</p>

                        <li> <b>Display Headings:</b> &nbsp; Display headings are used to stand out more than normal
                            headings (larger font-size and lighter font-weight), and there are four classes to choose
                            from: .display-1, .display-2, .display-3, .display-4

                    <h3>[4]What do you know about the Bootstrap Grid System?</h3>
                    <strong>Answer:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <h3>Grid system</h3>
                        <p>Bootstrap grid is a powerful system for building mobile-first layouts. It's very extensive
                            tool with a great number of options.</p>
                        <p>Bootstrap’s grid system uses a series of containers, rows, and columns to arrange and align
                            content. It’s built with flexbox and is fully responsive.</p>
                        <li><b>Container</b> &nbsp;Bootstrap requires a containing element to wrap site contents and
                            house our grid system. Without a container, the grid won't work properly.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Row</b>&nbsp;Rows create horizontal groups of columns. Therefore, if you want to split
                            your layout horizontally, use .row.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Columns</b>&nbsp;Bootstrap's grid system allows up to 12 columns across the page.</li>

                    <strong>Answer:</strong>
                    <div>It is an open-source framework from late 2011 that is used for designing responsive websites
                        with a mobile-first approach faster and easier. Bootstrap is available for HTML, CSS, and JS.
                        According to server-side languages like PHP, Node, etc. bootstrap helps to design the frontend.
                        Bootstrap has made the work for developers easier by making the templates ready which are basic
                        part of every website. Thus people tend to develop further and don’t waste time on basic
                        templates with beautiful designs along with responsiveness available. </div>

                        <strong>Answer:</strong>
                        <div>
                            “Button Groups” in Bootstrap is a class of name “btn-group” which is used to create series
                            of buttons in groups (without spaces) vertically or horizontally. This is the basic syntax
                            of the button group class where each button has its own class of “btn”
                        </div>
                        &lt;div class="btn-group"&gt;

                        &lt;/div&gt;
                        <p>Buttons have a default border-radius on the first and last buttons of the group.</p>

                        <strong>Answer:</strong>
                        <div><b>Bootstrap:</b> helps web developers to create thumbnails that are used to show linked
                            images in grids with the pre-defined classes which help to reduce codes length. Thumbnails
                            are created to provide a quick preview of images with small images.
                        </div>
                        <p><b>Thumbnail Image:</b> A thumbnail is a small image that represents a larger image.
                            Bootstrap has an easy way to do this with thumbnails. Bootstrap’s .thumbnail class is used
                            to show linked images in grids (grid system), a thumbnail is created using class .thumbnail
                            within the element &lt;a&gt;. The class .col-sm-* and .col-md-* (where * represent number ),
                            it is used to create grids of the images.</p>

                        <strong>Answer:</strong>
                        <div><b>Bootstrap 4 Flex</b> The biggest difference between Bootstrap 3 and Bootstrap 4 is that
                            Bootstrap 4 now uses flexbox, instead of floats, to handle the layout.</div><br>
                        <div>The Flexible Box Layout Module, makes it easier to design flexible responsive layout
                            structure without using float or positioning</div>
                        <p>It’s important to understand that Bootstrap 4’s grid system is built with Flexbox. What sets
                            Bootstrap apart from using Flexbox alone is the process of writing code. With Bootstrap, you
                            can create a grid using only HTML. With Flexbox, you must use HTML and CSS. Let’s take a
                            closer look at each process below.</p>
                        <p>Bootstrap has a twelve-column system, which means there can be up to twelve grid columns on a
                            single horizontal block. You can have more than twelve, they’ll just start to wrap rather
                            than show up on a single axis, regardless of the viewport.</p>
